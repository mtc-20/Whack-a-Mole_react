# Prerequisites
- `node.js`
- `expo.io`
- `react`

## Usage
- After cloning the repo
    ```
    cd my-project
    npm start run
    ```
    >Or even 
    >```
    >cd my-project
    >expo start
    >```

- This should open a page in your browser. 
  - To test live on Android,  install the [expo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent), and from the app, scan the QR code on the webpage
    >If it says network error on your android device, select `Tunnel` Connection from the left menu tab, and rescan the newly generated QR code
  - To test directly on your web browser, select `Run in web browser` from the left menu tab
  - Alternatively, it is possible to run them on "virtual" android or iOS (MacOS is required for testing on simulated iOS) devices, but I have not tried them yet. Please follow the [tutorial][1] for this approach  


## Future
- [ ] Introduce levels
- [ ] Figure out ways to host this as both app and website
- [ ] Add **Start** and **Reload** buttons
- [ ] Display Score adn player name at end
